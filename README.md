# Smart-irrigation-system-with-AI

The focus of the project is developing a smart irrigation system tailoring watering schedules and run times automatically to meet specific landscape needs. Smart or “precision” irrigation is defined as “a sustainable water saving method for maximizing crop yield and reducing the undesirable environmental impacts from irrigation.” Smart capability by AI (Machine Learning). A decision tree method will be incorporated as the analytic modeling tool. In this case it will be CHAID, a classification tree that predicts the target variable based on certain rules. The splitting of data is continuous and according to certain factors programmed in. There are other machine learning algorithms as shown. This will be a home irrigation controller, based on factors such as soil moisture, sunlight, temperature, and humidity. Soil moisture sensor controllers, evapotranspiration controllers, and rain sensors have been shown to save 20%–92%, 20%–71%, and 7%–50% of water, respectively, while maintaining crop growth and quality. Solar panels will be integrated for further efficiency.
